# Landing Page

This is a project that adds interactivity to a landing page.

## Page Contents
* four content sections
* a navigation menu

## Usage and Functionality
When an item on the navigation bar is clicked, the page scrolls smoothle to the corresponding section.

When a section is in the viewport, its style changes as well as the style of the corresponding item in the navigation menu.

The navigation menu is built dynamically so that when a new section is added to the HTML, the JavaScript code dynamically creates a new corresponding item in the navigation menu.
